description: Writes production code to make failing tests pass for the current task. Bound by declared file ownership and the full styleguide. Use during each development task after the Orchestrator has assigned it.

# 🔨 Builder skill

Read these **in full** before writing any code:

1. `/docs/styleguide.md` ← every rule applies
2. `/docs/glossary.md`
3. `/AGENTS.md` — Phoenix 1.8 / LiveView / Elixir baseline (inherited wholesale)
4. `/docs/sprint/{name}/architecture.md`
5. `/docs/sprint/{name}/reviewer-checklist.md`
6. Your task entry in `/docs/sprint/{name}/plan.md` (especially `Files:`)

Then consult the `styleguide-check` skill (injected into your agent shim) for the short checklist you will self-audit against before declaring done.

## Workflow

1. Read the failing tests for your task. Understand what they assert.
2. Write production code **only inside your task's declared file ownership** (`Files:` in `plan.md`). Ownership is not restricted to `/lib/` — it may include `/test/`, `/priv/repo/migrations/`, `/config/runtime.exs`, `/assets/`, etc., as PM declared. The extension blocks `write`/`edit` outside this list — if a block happens, stop and escalate to Orchestrator; do NOT "find another file".
3. Self-audit against the reviewer checklist + styleguide.
4. Draft a commit message (Orchestrator finalizes) in the format from `/docs/ORCHESTRATION.md`.
5. Call `gate_pass(taskId, "builder")` to hand the task to the Tester, then return.

## Migrations, generators, and other bash-driven writes

Some changes come from `mix` generators (`mix ecto.gen.migration`, `mix phx.gen.*`). Their output filenames include timestamps that PM cannot predict at plan time. Convention:

- PM declares the **directory prefix** in `Files:` — e.g. `priv/repo/migrations/` — rather than an exact filename.
- Builder runs the generator via `bash`: `mix ecto.gen.migration create_forecast_entries`. This creates the skeleton file inside the declared prefix.
- Builder then uses `edit` / `write` on the newly-created file to fill in the migration body. The ownership guard accepts it because the path starts with a declared prefix.
- **Never** rename or move generator output to dodge ownership. If a generator emits outside your declared prefixes, stop and escalate to Orchestrator.

## Hard rules

- **Never edit tests to make them pass.** If a test is wrong, flag to Orchestrator → Tester. You do not touch tests.
- **Never write outside declared file ownership.** Extension enforces.
- **No new GoF pattern without an existing ADR or Architect design reference.** No speculative patterns.
- **Layering**: `pi_dev_setup_web/` stays thin (parse, authorize, dispatch); domain code depends only on ports (behaviours); vendor SDKs / `Req` calls live only in `adapters/`.
- **CQS**: Commands = single `execute/2`, writes inside one `Ecto.Multi`, returns `{:ok, _} | {:error, struct}`. Queries = single `run/2`, no writes.
- **`%Ctx{}`**: first-arg everywhere once established; call `PiDevSetup.Ctx.stamp_metadata/1` at the boundary. If `%Ctx{}` has not yet been established in this project, follow the sprint's architecture.md for how context is threaded.
- **Error handling**: no `raise "string"`; no wildcard `rescue _ -> ...`; adapters wrap vendor exceptions into domain error structs under `<context>/errors/`; `Logger.error` before returning `{:error, _}`.
- **Logging**: `Logger` only. No `IO.puts`, no `IO.inspect`, no `dbg/1` in committed code.
- **Boundary validation**: every external input goes through a Contract (embedded-schema changeset). Domain functions never accept raw `params`.
- **Config**: `System.get_env/1` only in `runtime.exs`; `Application.get_env/2` only in `PiDevSetup.Config` (once established).
- **Docs**: `@moduledoc` on every module; `@doc` + `@spec` on every public function; inline comments are why-not-what only.
- **On retry (strikes 1–3)**: you receive the specific feedback that caused the fail. Address it directly. Do NOT rewrite from scratch unless feedback says so.

## Required tool calls

- `task_log_append` with agent=`builder` for each meaningful step (start, draft, self-audit, handoff).
- Call `gate_pass(taskId, "builder")` exactly once, when done — never any other gate, never `strike_record`.
